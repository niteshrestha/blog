            <p>It's been almost 6 months since Adobe Experience Design launched on Windows 10 and I'm in love with it. Since when it was first released lots of features has been added and more features are coming with monthly updates. Thanks to entire team for making such an amazing product that I love to use. I have been using Adobe XD on Windows 10 since Day 1 and the amount of work the team has done is absolutely fantastic. There are so many things I love about it and there are some thing that I wish was there in it and in this article I'm going to talk about things that make me happy using Adobe XD and things that I wish was available in it.</p>
<p>So first of all lets talk about things I love about it.</p>
<p>XD is amazingly <strong>simple</strong> tool to design UI/UX, if you read my previous article you would know that I used to use <a href="https://blog.niteshrestha.com.np/from-powerpoint-to-adobe-xd-3439e7adb518">Microsoft PowerPoint to design UI </a>because I couldn't be bothered to learn how to use Photoshop or Illustrator, I tried to design in Illustrator but it didn't work for me. Simply put I found other tools complex or I was lead to believe that they are complex and hard to use but XD is simply simple and easy to use. I didn't have to watch some video tutorials to start using XD, I just installed it and started using it and it was simple not very complex. I did look into the tutorial file that came with it and it was easy to learn. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23protip%20from%3Aelainecchao&amp;src=typd">#ProTips from Elaine Chao</a> also helped a lot to master XD. It doesn't take a lot of time to load, it's fast and smooth.</p>
<p><strong>Repeat Grid</strong>, this is on the top of my favorite things about XD. Repeat Grid, mind blown. It's such an amazing feature to have, I can't express how much I love this feature. It make life so much easier, no one likes to do same things again and again. Repeat Grid to rescue. Before I knew what Repeat Grid was I was copy pasting same thing again and again, and when I had to change font size or some other property I had to change it multiple times or select all elements and then change but Repeat Grid solves all those issue and makes your life a hell of a lot easier. If you haven't tried Repeat Grid in XD you are missing a lot. And Boolean Groups it's like one of those features that you didn't know you wanted but when you get it you are like I can't live without it.</p>
<p>When XD was first released in Windows 10 it had some reliability issue, it used to crash on me many times and I would loose all the unsaved work and it was annoying but the team fixed it and I don't remember when was the last time it crashed on me.</p>
<p>Over time XD has definitely become a better product and it continues to be better. To build an amazing product you need a team of amazing people which XD certainly has but there are few things that I wish was there in XD.</p>
<p>Dark Mode!!! I might even say this is the most important thing to me, I love Dark Mode. Dark mode on Windows 10, Dark Mode on my beloved Windows 10 Mobile and Dark Mode in Visual Studio. If XD had a Dark Mode that would make me a happy person, If you also want Dark Mode in XD go <a href="https://adobexd.uservoice.com/forums/353007-adobe-xd-feature-requests/suggestions/12940362-dark-interface-overall-ui-including-side-panels">Vote it</a>. Other thing that I'm waiting for is the Gradient colors.</p>
<p><strong>3rd Party plugins</strong> yes please, allowing 3rd party developers to extend XD with Plugins is a great idea and you should definitely <a href="https://adobexd.uservoice.com/forums/353007-adobe-xd-feature-requests/suggestions/12945705-allow-adobe-xd-to-have-third-party-plugins-extensi">vote it</a>.</p>
<p>Last but definitely not the least my ultimate wish <strong>Adobe XD Mobile for Windows 10 Mobile</strong>, this is undoubtedly the most important thing for me, it's more important than Dark Mode. I hope some day my wish will come true and if you want to help my wish come to go <a href="https://adobexd.uservoice.com/forums/353007-adobe-xd-feature-requests/suggestions/17598214-adobe-xd-mobile-support-for-windows-10-mobile">Vote for it</a>. Honestly my idea received more votes than I thought it would so I'm hopeful about it happening SoonΓäó</p>
<p>So far I'm a happy man using Adobe XD and definitely check out <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23protip%20from%3Aelainecchao&amp;src=typd">#ProTips from Elaine Chao</a></p>
